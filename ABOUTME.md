# Michaela Tadlip 
_Hi, I am Mary Michaela Tadlip, but I prefer to be called “Michaela.” I was born and raised in the Philippines._ 
- 🔭 Currently, I don't have a work, but I'm looking forward to be a Retail Assistant and Cashier. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science 💻! Last year, I love to do coding for fun. However, When I go through to my pathway which is Electrical Engineering this course might be helpful for me. The reason why I didn't drop this course when I was supposed to change it to other subject. 
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me on my school email. Just emailed me because I always DND my phone for all social media notifications except the Gmail and Google Classroom. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She 👧
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't like neither dog 🐶 nor cat 🐱. I don't hate them but they either follow me or chase me. 

## My Whakapapa 
Family Background 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧
- I have 3 siblings, 2 sisters and 1 little brother.
- I only speak English and Tagalog. 

### My Interests

-  I like being crafty sometimes.
-  I don’t watch Netflix that much, but I am waiting for the new season of “All of Us Are Dead.”
-  I am a Kpop stan—Seventeen. My biases are Seungcheol and Joshua, and my bias wrecker is Vernon.

### My Future Goals  
What would you like to achieve:
In the future, I will be an engineer. You will see 'Engr. Michaela' in my name. I also want to live a leisurely life, free from worries, where I can simply enjoy myself.
